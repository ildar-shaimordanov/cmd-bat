# shell scripts

Collection of shell scripts (both bash and POSIX-compatible)

Demo scripts are under the `*/t` directories.

Run the `./update-readme` script from the directory where you would like
to update the `README.md` file. For example:
 
    ./update-readme

or run the command that is common for all cases:

    ../update-readme > README.md

Try `shelldoc` itself to learn its usage.
