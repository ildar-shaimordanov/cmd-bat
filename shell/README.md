# shell scripts

Collection of shell scripts (both bash and POSIX-compatible)

Demo scripts are under the `*/t` directories.

Use the `update-readme` script from that directory where you would like
to update the `README.md` file. For example:

    ../update-readme > README.md

or (if a file with the same name exists in the current directory
 
    ./update-readme

Try it without options and redirections to learn its usage.
