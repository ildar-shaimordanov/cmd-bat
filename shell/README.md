# shell scripts

Collection of shell scripts (both bash and POSIX-compatible)

Demo scripts are under the `*/t` directories.

Use the `run-shelldoc` script from that directory where you would like
to update the `README.md` file. For example:

    ../run-shelldoc > README.md

Try it without options and redirections to learn its usage.
