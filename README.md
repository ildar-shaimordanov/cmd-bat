# my-scripts

It's set of my scripts. Since some script exists, I had or still have a need in the functionality it implements. Or the script was written just for fun. Why not?

Initially it was named as *cmd.scripts* for keeping cmd/batch scripts only. Nowaday I decided to reorder the scripts, combine them with the scripts from another repositories and written in another languages and also rename this repository.
